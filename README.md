Generate Font Awesome webfonts with only the glyphs you need. Much implentation inspiration taken from the Fontello project.

**Usage:** `node ./ heart times star` and find your < 1kb (924 bytes) webfont in `/generated`.

*Note:* I only made this because I couldn't find anything like it on the web. I barely know what I'm doing. If you can, fork it and improve it (or bring an alternative) so I can use that instead.
