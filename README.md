Generate a webfont with only the glyphs you need. (Most of the code is from the Fontello project.)

Point is to be able to make a gulp task and automate the creation of an optimized webfont.

*Note:* I only made this because I couldn't find anything like it on the web. I barely know what I'm doing. If you can, fork it and improve it (or bring an alternative) so I can use that instead.
